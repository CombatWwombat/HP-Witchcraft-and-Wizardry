Gameplay:

  [] the blender in the kitchen should have functional buttons

  [] fusebox in attic should contain interactable switches to turn off the power in the house
    -> Thomas: I need to work on a good power system to handle stuff like this neatly



Visuals/Sound:

  [x] the tv upstairs directly plays sound when you play the map... it should work like all other tvs in the house

  [] the radio sound distance is not realistic when you walk away you still hear the same sound volume... All sounds should be configured like a realistic envoirment. for example when you walk upstairs that the sound will cut away or atleast fades away **take a look at the television sound. its perfectly configured with a realistic sound distance when you walk away.. but maby you can make it even better

  [x] the smoke of the fireplace comes inside the house... it should perfectly fit inside the chimey not inside the house



Quality of life:

  [] lights and appliances stop when their power cord breaks.
